### Master Diploma
I completed the international master program in [Machine Learning and Data Mining](https://mldm.univ-st-etienne.fr/overview.php) at the [Jean Monnet University](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html) in Saint-Étienne, France, from 2021 to 2023.

### Thesis
I wrote my Master Thesis during my internship at [Ava](https://www.ava.me/), a company dedicated to empowering deaf and hard-of-hearing people through their AI live captioning solution. There, I focused on the exploration and adaptation of classic Active Learning techniques to the task of Speaker Diarization, supervised by Bertrand Higy and Hervé Bredin. You can read the thesis [here](thesis/MasterThesis_BeltranCastro.pdf).
